## Hi! Clever_Jimmy here!

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm an ordinary student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on solving combinatorial optimization problems with machine learning methods.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning school curriculums such as Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, and Digital Logic Design(which, sadly, turned out to be quite boring).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my school life on campus!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: via email at leverimmy@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he or him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm using the ID `leverimmy` because GitHub usernames must not contain underlines. Well, try to remove all the non-lowercase letters in `Clever_Jimmy`!
